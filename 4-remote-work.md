# Remote work

Collection of resources and notes about work and what the future of it might look like.

## [Future of work][1]
- people find remote collaboration more mentally challenging,
- overwork and stress are significantly higher in video meetings than non-meeting work
- recommend taking regular breaks every two hours to let your brain re-charge,
- limiting meetings to 30 minutes, or punctuating long meetings with small breaks when possible
- future work will likely be a fluid mix of in-person and remote collaboration
- people feel less connected to their colleagues since working remotely more often


## [How to do hybrid right][2]
- traditional model: constrained location + constrained schedule
- unconstrained location means working from anywhere
- unconstrained schedule means working anytime
- jobs and tasks
  - drivers of productivity: energy, focus, coordination, and cooperation
  - Innovation is stimulated by face-to-face contact
- employee preferences
  - home office situation, tenure, lifestyle, temporary situations
- projects and workflows
  - team coordination is straightforward when the location and schedule are constrained
  - leverage tech to explore new ways of work execution
- inclusion and fairness
  - varying degrees of flexibility give rise to accusations of unfairness

## [Remote work report 2021][3]
- 52% of remote workers consider leaving their co-located company for a remote role
- easier to feel like part of a team when you can easily see what others are working toward
- 70% of organizations default to tools (video, chat, and phone) used for office-centric, largely synchronous workflows
- Nearly half (48%) of teams would call a meeting before communicating asynchronously
