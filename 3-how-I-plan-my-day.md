# How I plan my day

Organising your day is one the things that have a high impact on productivity.
I don't want to go too much into motivational aspects or _pro tips_ for
achieving hyper-focus and getting into _the flow_ - there are countless opinions about this already.

What I want to share is a practical, methodological approach to I follow to help me plan my work day and avoid forgetting stuff.
It is not a fancy system, quite the opposite - it is intentionally simple so that it can be done on a computer, phone, paper and maybe even on a watch.
There are just enough rules to make it effective, but not too many so it won't get in my way.

I plan my day using a simple list, with four sections:

1. a title, mentioning the date and tag (because my notes app will then allow me to filter and sort based on it)
1. what was done previously, one per line
1. what is to be done today, one per line
1. unstructured "bellow the fold" area for anything worth mentioning

Here is an example:

```
2020-11-28 #worklog

Previously
[x] define api schema for big-feature-x
[-] implement new api
[ ] deploy to prod

Today
[ ] implement new api
[ ] deploy to prod
[ ] integrate new api with service Alpha30

---

Talk to @jsmith to get credentials for integration with api
```

And these are the rules to make this system worthwhile for me:
- `[x]` for things that are complete
- `[-]` for things that were started but not complete. There might be a reason for this if so, it will be noted "below the fold"
- `[ ]` for things to be done
- At the start of each day:
    1. duplicate the note from the previous day
    2. update the date in the `title`
    3. move everything in the `today` section into `previously`
    4. write down `today` and clean up the `below the fold` section as appropriate

This helps me keep my day focused.
With a quick glance at this I can recall my thoughts and to continue where I left off.
Just by looking at the shape of a note, I can tell if it was a quiet or a chaotic day or whether I was able to reach my goals or not.
It is also a good format to look at when doing retrospectives or sharing with peers when asked __how's work going?__

The fact that there are no mentions to meeting slots here is intentional.
I only write them down when I need preparations for them, otherwise a notification from the calendar
will show up when it's the time.

It's hard to get the right level of detail on each entry.
Too broad and generic and it probably won't be marked as done (`[x]`) for a long time.
If it's too narrow and specific then there will be a plethora of entries, making it hard to grasp
just how much of **meaningful** work there is.

Over time I started getting better at planing my day, summarising and estimating each goal so that I could
reach the end of the day with everything marked as done.
If I carry over more than one entry, then I was failed to understand the complexity or was over-confident.
When I mark everything as done and still there's plenty of sunlight ahead, then I am probably lacking
the focus or ambition, ultimately being inefficient with my time and energy.
